# 📊 Sorting Visualizer - Bubble Sort

The **Sorting Visualizer** is an interactive tool that visually demonstrates the process of sorting an array using the **Bubble Sort Algorithm**. Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project helps you understand how Bubble Sort works through dynamic animations and color-coded comparisons.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Tech         | Role                           |
|--------------|--------------------------------|
| **HTML5**    | Structure of the web page      |
| **CSS3**     | Styling and layout             |
| **JavaScript** | Core sorting logic and visuals |
| `canvas` or `DOM` | Used for drawing/simulating bars |

## 🧠 How Bubble Sort Works

Bubble Sort compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they're in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

**Time Complexity:**
- Best Case: O(n)
- Average Case: O(n²)
- Worst Case: O(n²)

**Space Complexity:** O(1)  
It is a **stable** and **in-place** sorting algorithm.
